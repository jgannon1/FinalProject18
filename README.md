This game is a slight variation on the conventional game of "BlackJack". The only differences between traditional BlakJack and this game is the values of face cards and aces. Ace, Jack, Queen, and King are equal to 1, 11, 12, and 13 respectively. In addition, like traditional BlackJack the dealer hits on 13, and if the player busts the dealer automatically wins, similarly, if the dealer and player ties, the dealer wins.
